		<p class="headlineText">Most accounts of refugees after WWII focus on the large number of displaced people that had lost their homes as a result of desolation from the war and the reorganization of Germany. Bodenreform, translated literally as “land reform” in German, is a term used to describe the reorganization of land that took place in the former territories of East Germany and present day Poland after the Potsdam Agreement;</p>

				In this reorganization that occured in Gemrany, large estates - mostly owned by noble families, 

				were confiscated, the land distributed among cottagers, landless farmhands, 

				and displaced people with Polish or Soviet ancestry. A large estate was 

				anything that was over 50 Hectares (around 100 acres). The territories being 

				referred to in this analysis are primarily Pomerania and Silesia, two large 

				German States, which ended up being controlled by the Soviet Military 

				Administration in Germany (SMAD).

				Bodenreform was an interesting case when looking from the perspective of

				the resettlement of refugees; it both created refugees and helped settle past 

				polish refugees displaced from wartime. It also served as a huge tool for the 

				redistribution of wealth in Germany and Poland, permanently changing the 

				social landscape. It took from the rich and gave to the poor.
			</p>
			<p class="projectDescription">
				It also acted to confiscate those estates owned by Nazi’s convicted of War

				Crimes, but this only amounted for about 4% of the land confiscated. For the 

				most part, the historic nobility of Silesia and Pomerania had owned the 

				confiscated land, sometimes dating back to 1,000 years depending on the 

				family. These families were referred to as Junkers when no other title was 

				present. This is the name we will call them by for the rest of the analysis.

			<p class="projectDescription">
				When the communist parties of Poland and Soviet Russia seized these

				estates, the Estate owners were given no compensation and were robbed of 

				all of their belongings, from dishware to family heirlooms. This 

				reorganization still holds in modern day, as some families have sued the state 

				to regain their former estates or gain compensation, virtually all of which 

				requests have been denied.

			<p class="projectDescription"> In many ways this group of formerly well off land owners were left worse

			than the common man when invading forces came through the Eastern front. 

			This group got relatively no sympathy internationally or domestically. Even 

			under the Nazi regime, this group had started to lose its land and influence. 

			Their role as semi-feudal agricultural entity had really lost its importance. 

			There was no need to keep these large estates running because the noble 

			families that owned them no longer possessed the political influence that 

			they once did. The political world saw this, and decided to exploit their 

			position. Some of these estate owners were unjustly convicted of war crimes, 

			as an excuse to seize their businesses or land that could not be legally 

			reorganized by the Potsdam agreement. There was no effort to stop these 

			accusations by the United States or any other members of the Big Three (US, 

			Soviets, Britain).
			</p>
			<img src="photos/topic2/injured.png" alt="hi" class="inline"/>
			</p class="projectDescription">Furthermore, because this group was part of a forgotten ruling class and

			formerly controlled large amounts of wealth and land, nobody blinked an eye 

			when the tables were turned and the wealth was redistributed. The fragile 

			post war economy also contributed to this neglect. Most European countries 

			were too focused on their own reconstruction and sufferings to lend a hand. 

			Furthermore, no one wanted to protect the formerly wealthy’s assets, when 

			virtually everyone was poor and trying to avoid starvation. 
			</p>
			<img src="photos/topic2/injured_woman.png" alt="hi" class="inline"/>
			</p class="projectDescription">The treatment of the large estate owners from Silesia and Pomerania as a

			result of this was very unfortunate. In the case of these land owners, they 

			were given very little consideration during the annexation and were often 

			times killed without mercy. If they weren’t killed they would be put in labor 

			camps under the guise that they had been war criminals. First hand accounts 

			also cite more brutal treatment to these large state owners because of a 

			mistaken belief that they had more to do with the war than the common man 

			or the peasants. This was an incorrect assumption as these estate owners 

			had been largely disowned by Berlin and the Nazi regime. One can see the 

			brutal treatment through this first hand account of the Graf von Lehndorff on 

			the seizure of his family’s estate:  "my brother was seriously injured with a 

			knife… Then other Russians came, asked who he was, and shot him and my 

			mother together.’ Who cared that [my] mother had previously been detained 

			by the Gestapo?” (Habbe, Spiegel). This account paints the picture of these 

			large estate owners well; they were under persecution from the Nazi’s and 

			under persecution from the invading forces from the east. They were 

			essentially left without any sympathetic parties.

			<p class="projectDescription"> The United States and Great Britain had a very standoffish approach, doing

			nothing to stop the seizure and reorganization of Eastern Germany. Both 

			allies wanted to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union, so they took a 

			passive stance on the issue. The US originally held that it would not concede 

			to supporting the annexation of Eastern Germany without the consent of its 

			people, but eventually gave into Soviet pressures with President Roosevelt 

			citing that he wouldn’t object to resettlement. Roosevelt’s only condition was 

			that “any transfers that take place should be effected in an orderly and 

			humane manner” (history.state.gov). After this point, both the US and Great 

			Britain actively worked with the Soviets to relocate the people who were 

			annexed from the eastern territories. By avoiding confrontation with the 

			Soviets, around 14,000,000 ethnic Germans lost their homes and cultural 

			heritage. Furthermore, the Potsdam agreement was supposed to be a 

			temporary point of which would be revisited at a later time to determine 

			what to do with the annexed territories, however the US and Great Britain 

			allowed this agreement to become permanent by standing by.
			<p class="projectDescription"> Although the US helped relocate these displaced people to Western Germany

			and Austria, it made no effort to get their belongings back or give them any 

			compensation for their ancestral homes. Part of this stemmed from the 

			denigration of the German people in the international sphere. Neither the 

			Soviets nor the Poles felt that the Germans deserved any consideration due 

			to their atrocities during the war. This relocation and the atrocities that 

			resulted from it were therefore significantly motivated by a factor of revenge. 

			Europe and the rest of the international sphere also had little sympathy 

			towards Germany for the innumerable atrocities during the war. Because of 

			this, the US did not want to touch the issue in fear of stirring the pot, and 

			figured it would be easier to simply assist in the relocation of this group. 

			Later after the Potsdam Agreement was concluded, US Secretary of State 

			James Byrne claimed: "I regret being unable to see any sign of decisiveness 

			on our part (Habbe, Spiegel).” This lack of decisiveness ended up costing 

			around 1.5 million German civilian lives, and robbed a third of Germany of 

			their cultural heritage (Radvany, NY Times).
			</p>
			<p class="projectDescription">
				US media coverage on the issue was similar to their policy stances, relatively

				passive and standoffish. When the atrocities from relocation of the eastern 

				German population became overly apparent through the massive death tolls, 

				the US and Great Britain decided to become more vocal about their distaste 

				of the relocation. The US State Department conferred their disgust by writing 

				in a telegram to the Polish Government expressing their distaste in “the 

				massive misery and poor treatment of weak and helpless people” (Habbe, 

				Spiegel). Great Britain also responded in the form of Winston Churchill as he 

				characterized the deportations as a “tragedy on a prodigious scale” (Habbe, 

				Spiegel). Despite these angry words, little action was taken to limit the 

				brutality that was running rampant in the countryside’s of East Germany and 

				the communist zone.
			</p>
			<p class="projectDescription">
				Furthermore, the language used to describe the former German territories in

				mainstream media was very unsympathetic in the West. When discussing the 

				territories, the New York Times would often call them the “regained” 

				territories of Poland, and they were often represented as territories that had 

				for a short time been German. This contradicted the reality in that these 

				territories had been German for the better part of the last millennia.
			</p>
			<p class="projectDescription">
				The US was also reluctant to write about the injustices hurled on the Junkers

				in mainstream media because they represented something that America has 

				always opposed: aristocracy. Americans had very little sympathy for people 

				who had ruled through hereditary titles. This trend dates back to the 

				American Revolution. They showed this distaste by covering this topic very 

				minimally in mainstream media. The majority of the coverage in mainstream 

				media focused on the suffering of the displaced people who had been 

				peasants or small time business men, while the formerly aristocratic Junkers 

				were only talked about in terms of how they have lost their importance to 

				their country, and how it was in some ways a good thing as it was their time 

				to go. No one in the West seemed to think that by taking away all of their 

				belongings and expelling them from their ancestral homeland that they were 

				being treated with undo harshness because of their former aristocratic 

				status.
			</p>
			<p class="projectDescription">
				As a result of this lack of attention, virtually all of the Junkers of East

				Germany have failed to regain their former estates, belongings, and cultural 

				heritage. The rulings to regain the plots of land confiscated in what is now 

				modern day Poland require that one proves that the seizure was unlawful at 

				the time of seizure. This really makes it impossible to regain the land as any 

				land over 50 Hectares (around 100 acres) was seized by the communist 

				regime legally. Furthermore, Germany holds that it cannot legally give back 

				land that is no longer under their control. Nonetheless, this hasn’t stopped 

				many former landowners from taking up petitions for their former land in 

				recent years. This revival of the claims on former land is in part because of 

				the changing attitude of Media in the West towards these former aristocrats.

				In recent years, the sympathy towards the displaced Germans of East

				Germany has grown, especially when one is considering the former 

				powerful Junkers. In the last twenty years, there has been a lot of media 

				coverage of former aristocrats trying to claim their ancestral homes back. 

				The NY times most notably changed their stance on this issue. One can 

				start by seeing it in Egon Radvany’s 1990 Times Article, expressing that it 

				is time for Poland to apologize for what they did to the Germans during 

				the expulsions, and in part acknowledge the injustices that they 

				themselves committed so Europe can move on. Coverage like this has 

				sparked recent movements to change the laws that constitute regaining 

				the annexed land.

				Most notably, a descendent of the house of Habsburg regained his family’s

				ancestral castle, the Castle of Bran. This castle was present in Romania 

				and was regained as a result of a recent Romanian law that was passed to 

				return all illegally expropriated lands to their former heirs. These cases 

				are few and far between, but Media coverage has been snowballing this 

				issue and getting it into many assembly rooms throughout Europe. 

				Unfortunately, most countries have not been as understanding at 

				Romania, and the Junkers of Silesia and Pomerania have seen very little 

				progress on this front; Poland has neglected to make any legal changes 

				regarding the illegal expropriation of land after Potsdam. Nonetheless, 

				the Bran castle case of Romania serves to inspire many former Junker 

				families and continues to gain attention in mainstream media in an 

				attempt to help these families regain some of their cultural heritage.
