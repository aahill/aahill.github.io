			    <p class="headlineText"> Experimental Genotype to Phenotype mapping in evolutionary robotics</p>
			</div>
			<p class="projectDescription"> An ongoing collaborative research project to create a genotype to phenotype (G2P) map that examines the idea that the modularity of an organism's genetic code is closely related to its ability to survive and reproduce in a given environment. Modularity is defined as the tendency for segments of the genetic code to 'stick together' after reproduction and genetic recombination. The term 'genotype to phenotype' explores the translation of an organism's genetic information to its physical traits, particularly before and after it reaches maturity.</p> 

			<p>Using reprogrammable robots, we are working on a method of simulating the above translation that breaks away from conventional G2P modeling. Starting with an arbitrary string of genetic code, our aim is to develop a method in which the code gradually develops modularity; that is to say that segments of the code continue to be passed down between generations of robots. We currently plan on publishing our findings in early 2016.</p>

			<div class ="projectTitle">
			    <p class="headlineText"> Simulating cloud-based services for self-driving cars </p>
			</div>
			<p class='ProjectDescription'> A web application that allows a person to see how multiple self-driving react to road incidents in real time. Using a street map API and several canvas objects, cars would be represented as graphical objects on a map traveling along a user-defined travel route. Incidents can be placed in the way of the car's path; when encountered, the car broadcasts the incident location to other cars in the area using network calls. These cars in turn reroute to avoid the incident area.  </p>
