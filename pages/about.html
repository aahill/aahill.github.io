	<h3>I make things.</h3>

	<p>Hello, I'm Aaron. I am a developer, researcher and student in New York.</p>
	<p>I love making and doing things in new ways, especially with people who's curiosity and creativity matches my own. I've worked on evolutionary robotics with cognitive scientists, linguistic models with linguists, and driverless car simulations with other software developers. My passion to create, explore and learn is constant, and I'm always searching for the next exciting thing. Here are some of my previous experiences:</p>

	<ul>
		<li> used python frameworks to extract and understand the sentement of twitter posts </li>
		<li> built a web-app to analyze the sensor data coming from driverless cars </li>
		<li> designed web UIs using cutting-edge frameworks, such as AngularJS </li>
		<li> co-created a new way of modeling gene expression in evolvable robots </li>
		<li> hacked linux onto a chromebook</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I don't know where the future might take me, but as long as there are problems to be solved, questions to be asked, and fresh coffee, I'll be fine.</p>
