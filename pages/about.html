	<p>My name is Aaron Hill. I'm a developer, problem solver, and student researcher in New York. 

	I love doing new things in new ways. From web-stuff, to language, to evolutionary robotics, I my passion for exploration and application knows no bounds. Here's a few things that I've done:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> used python frameworks to extract and understand the sentement twitter posts </li>
		<li> built a web-app to analyze the sensor data coming from driverless cars </li>
		<li> designed web UIs using cutting-edge frameworks </li>
		<li> created a new way of modeling gene expression in evolvable robots </li>
		<li> hacked linux onto a chromebook</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I'm always looking for the next exciting thing!</p>
